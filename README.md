# Exercise 1
Using the text-edit of your choice (e.g., Atom), create a new file called README.md. Alternatively, you may clone this repository and edit this file.

In your README.md document, put your favorite quote in a block quote, and provide a link to a website that provides additional information about the quote.

Note that you can preview this Markdown in Atom to make sure it works correctly.
